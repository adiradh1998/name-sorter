# Name Sorter

This a simple C# name sorting solution

## Files
I've included the name-sorter main project as well as the Unit Test project.
If you wish to view the code and run unit tests, please use the name-sorter and name-sorter-Tests folders (as well as the sln to build the solution)

I've included a published executable for Windows 10 if your device runs it. The executable should run on other OS's as well, but I haven't had time to check it.

A basic Travis build pipeline has also been set up.
